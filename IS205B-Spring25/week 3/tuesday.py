bill = 45
half = bill / 2
print(half)
thirds = bill /3
print(thirds)

## think about this is decimal percent

half = bill * .5
print(half)

print(bill * .6, bill * .4)

## calculating proportion

total = 135
share = 32

my_proportion = share / total
print(my_proportion)

next_bill = 1300
your_next_share = next_bill * my_proportion
print(your_next_share)
