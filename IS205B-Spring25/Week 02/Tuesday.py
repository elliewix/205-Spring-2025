print("hello")

# data types
print(1)
print("1")

# operators

print(1 + 1)
print(1.0 + 1.0)
print(1.0 + 1)

# you can extend to other types
## not always
# print("cat" + 1) # won't work, str and int
print("this is accurate tho")

print("cat" + "cat")

# boolean values
print(True)
print(False)

# diff than
print("True")
print("False")
print("false")

## python has eyes of its own
## things are still happening
1 + 1
"cat" + "cat"
# but to see the output you need print()

## variables
## variable names: there are some rules

number = 5

# maybe like coords like (x,y)
x = 5
y = 5
print(x)
print(y)
print(x + y)

# print("cat" + x)

## but you to give varibales a decent name
## something meaningful

total = 0

# calculate the mean/avg

n = 10
total = 50
mean = total/n
print("my average is")
print(mean)
