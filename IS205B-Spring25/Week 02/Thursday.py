# varible names

# we know that....
## they can't start with numbers
## punctuation is tricky
## reserved words etc.
## the above are all just not allowed

## style.... things that are allowable but bad
## single letter variables that don't make sense to the problm

# warning, strong warning

# DONT reuse function names for variables
# the big ones at hand are, min, max, sum

print(sum([1,2,4]))

sum = sum([1,2,4]) # oops
print(sum)
# print(sum([3,5,6]))
