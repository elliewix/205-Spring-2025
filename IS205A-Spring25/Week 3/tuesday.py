## represent portions by decimal percent

print(bill_total * .5)

## flexibility to adjust the proportions

print(bill_total * .6)
print(bill_total * .4)

## let's calculate the proportion separately

total_cost = 135
your_share = 32
print(your_share / total_cost)

your_prop = your_share / total_cost

new_bill = 1300
my_new_share = new_bill * your_prop
print(my_new_share)
